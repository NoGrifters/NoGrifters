# What is NoGrifters?

The name says it all, yet there's so much more it doesn't say. NoGrifters at its core is an idea, an ideology, an ethos. It is a rallying cry to fight against those who are the biggest threat to the crypto ecosystem. NoGrifters is an ethos that promotes true builders, those with integrity who hold to the values of decentralisation without compromise. The end goal is for NoGrifters to become a network state, a society of people who contribute value, rather than extract it.

To get there, NoGrifters is building a company as well as a community. The company exists to build decentralised consumer products, so as to perpetuate the crypto ethos. These products will be both technologically decentralised, but also clearly display the value that decentralisation adds to the product. NoGrifters builds community through products, and will in turn attract people to build products for NoGrifters. In many ways, this can be thought of like an NFT PFP collection. The key difference is that NoGrifters has a clearly defined culture, and this culture can be clearly reflected by the products it builds. This is in contrast to most NFT collections where the culture is emergent, and the products (if any) are totally unrelated to the culture.
