Communication all in public (except for private dms between people, but that should be kept to a minimum)
All code is open source
All docs are open source and published to a website

# Tools
[https://web.hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) - annotating on the public repo
Farcaster - internal communication (slack replacement)
Github - monorepo for code and docs (stored in markdown)
