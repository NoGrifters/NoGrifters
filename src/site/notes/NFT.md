### Objectives
- build a community. Give a way for people to *act* on their strong alignment with values
- allow the community to identify each other and empower each other
- end goal: become a network state, a society for the 1% of producers, those that contribute most of the value to society
### Features
- owning an nft gives you access to any nogrifters office. This is possible because we build in open and everything is open source :D
- Non-transferrable
- can be slashed by sufficient community quorum
	- Slashing mechanism is upgradeable by community vote
- Referral mint gets referral fees??
- [[Nouns\|Nouns]] style but have to figure out a way to make supply elastic
- tweet from the [[Products/Twitter account\|NoGrifters account]]?

### Minting
[[EIP1559\|EIP1559]] style. Can send a bid at a certain price, it'll get fulfilled automatically when the auction goes down to that price. Can top up by sending more money to the contract. Can cancel by sending another tx. Maybe make every new user the keeper network so don't need to run a 3rd party keeper network? Kind of like the pay it forward trend at drive thrus/supermarket checkouts where people in front pay for the person behind them. The person who bids pays for the next person to mint it, but their bid will eventually get minted by someone else's transaction. 
Can take advantage of [[EPNS\|EPNS]] to get notifications for when a person's transaction has gone through.

### Supply
Uncapped supply

### NoGrifters collective NFT

- used for paying salaries as well

### NoGrifters prize
