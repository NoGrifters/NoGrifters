### Objectives
- build a community. Give a way for people to *act* on their strong alignment with values
- allow the community to identify each other and empower each other
- end goal: become a network state, a society for the 1% of producers, those that contribute most of the value to society
### Features
- owning an nft gives you access to any nogrifters office. This is possible because we build in open and everything is open source :D
- Non-transferrable
- can be slashed by sufficient community quorum
	- Slashing mechanism is upgradeable by community vote
- Referral mint gets referral fees??
- nouns style but have to figure out a way to make supply elastic
- tweet from the NoGrifters account?

- used for paying salaries as well
