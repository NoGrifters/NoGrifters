The aim is to achieve as good of an experience as working in a top tier tech company, whilst providing significant incentive to talented builders to stay within the company to innovate rather than leave to run their own startup. The company should be able to satisfy all their needs.

Members can join with an idea already in mind, or pick up an idea, or work for the core company.

## Compensation
### Objectives
- incentivise value generated per capita
- satisfy everyone adequately, however not catering for greed
### Implementation
- everyone gets a salary (UBI)
- everyone gets equity in the overarching company as well as their own product
- everyone has a vote over governance proposals for the treasury which can include spending money on individuals

50% equity of the product is owned by the company, 50% of equity is owned by the team working on it. The justification behind this is that as a team working on a product, you need ownership over it, and sharing ownership with the company provides the incentive to keep supporting you. 50% may seem like a lot but that's only 1 year of growth for a company that is doubling each year. In return for equity over the product, the company provides network effects such as brand and distribution, dev tooling, advice, professional network, and of course the salaries.

# Thoughts
Companies should not be beholden to people who do not work for the company. Yet they should remember that their purpose is to serve society, not to serve themselves. People outside the company can invest in it and benefit from the company's profit, but they should not be able to make decisions for the company. The law should be the last resort for keeping a company's actions in check.

### Compensation
Perhaps use an AMM-LP style mechanism for ownership in the company equity. This is to make it fair for entrants at any stage. So that purely by being early doesn't mean you get to reap all the rewards of the value created by people who joined later. You need to keep creating value in order to earn. Example: product which joins first but only 10m market cap will be diluted by later product which joins at 1m market cap initially, but grows to become 100m.

It may not be a bad thing to have people earn nothing when they first join. This acts as a filter so that only the truly dedicated will join. They will receive their fair share when whatever they build starts growing, and they vest their equity in the collective through that. If they don't get any traction, they don't get to vest the equity in the collective.
