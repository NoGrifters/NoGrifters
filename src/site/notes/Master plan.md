The end goal for NoGrifters is to become a network state, filled with citizens who hold the ethos of a true builder. Only through sovereignty at the state level are builders able to move forward without the looming threat of interference.

Attract the best people. The way to do this is through mission and culture, not strictly money. This is the main metric to index on. Everything the company does should be done to attract the very best to join. Where ultimately will be large enough to form a network state.

The way to achieve sovereignty is through economic diplomacy.

“Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate.” - [Tom Goodwin](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/in-the-age-of-disintermediation-the-battle-is-all-for-the-customer-interface/)
