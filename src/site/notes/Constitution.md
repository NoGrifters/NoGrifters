This document provides a set of rules that dictate "[[Grifters\|What does it mean to not be a grifter?]]"

1. Thou shalt not steal.
2. All code is open source. At the minimum, able to be read. Highly recommended to accept contributions as well. Allowing others to fork it is optional.
3. Do not take custody of other's assets. This doesn't extend to personal use (e.g. holding a family member's NFT temporarily).
