Use a static site generator to turn markdown docs into a wiki. CD with github actions.

- have everything in the same repo as the codebase so no need to switch between them. monorepo ftw
- have it easily editable by contributors, important for scaling the documentation
	- ideally available on website as well as any text editor (e.g. Obsidian, vs code)
- have it easily viewable on a website
