Structured as a DAO. Meaning, all the finances of the company are onchain. Salaries are publicly viewable, amount of money in the balance sheet is publicly viewable. Equity of the company is represented as the Lyra token which is publicly traded. There is also a small company set up to handle the fiat payments (e.g. rent).

### Shortcomings
- I think having the token used as equity as well as incentivisation for the product causes misalignment of incentives. The company should be separate from the token used for the product. https://twitter.com/rayzhueth/status/1594954812092997632?s=20&t=7LxH4toHYYhYmHIwKpKXnA

### Questions
- What are some legal issues to watch out for?
- How is the token structured?
	- Do investors get equity in the company as well or just the token?
- What are the challenges with doing everything fully onchain?
