**Build with integrity**
Economic sustainability
Credible neutrality 
     No discounts for insiders
     No elevated platforms at party venues
Conviction pays off in the long run. "Play infinite games"
Cooperation over competition
Verifiably secure aka "Can't be evil"
We can do better
Welcome criticism
"And then they join you" - critical towards outsiders, yet welcoming when they do repent
Honour the labourer - give honour to those who toil, and to those who hold faith
The community is the number one priority

# Company Values
Company values are a superset of brand values which also includes values specific to company processes, compensation, etc.

- People should be paid fairly
- Reward those who are faithful
- Act as if you have nothing to lose, because you don't
- Challenge the status quo

# Engineering Values
Open source everything - a means of building in public

Interoperability/legibility over efficiency - it doesn't matter if you write the most perfect code if no one else can understand it. We want the community to be able to verify our code, and also build on top of it. Choose common tech!
