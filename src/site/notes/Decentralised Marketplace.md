Problem: Solving the NFT curation problem (and censorship)
Tackle this problem because this is the only case where mainstream users care about censorship.

Long term vision: become the home for NFTs on the web. Integrate all types of NFTFi. Be the Google of NFTs

Strategy: aggressively adopt public goods, as long as they are cheaper to use than recreate ourselves. Make decentralisation accessible.

Mission: Make decentralisation commercially viable. Make decentralisation valued by the world.
